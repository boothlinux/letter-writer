# What is letter-writer? 
Letter-writer is a small program used to generate letters to multiple recepients easily. This is all done in only 69 (nice) lines of Python code, including empty lines and comments.

The only libraries needed to run letter-writer are PySimpleGui and python-docx. Letter-writer has been tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can use PyInstaller to generate a .exe or .app that can be run on any machine, even if Python is not installed on that machine.

I've released this under the Apache 2.0 licence so feel free to use letter-writer for your own projects. Contributions are very welcome, please submit a pull request here on GitHub
